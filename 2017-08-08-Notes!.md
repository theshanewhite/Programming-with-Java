Notes for Unity

# Using the Editor

### Hotkeys for Move, Rotate and Scale

**W : Move**

**E : Rotate**

**R : Scale**

### Create a Prefab

1. Select group of objects in the scene

2. Drag from Hierarchy to Project

3. (Keep your Project folder Organized!)

    1. Right click in Project > Create > Folder

### Creating a New Primitive Object

Right click in Hierarchy > 3D Object > choose object you want

### Adding a Rigidbody (Turn on Physics)

1. Select object in scene or hierarchy

2. In the Inspector, at the bottom, choose **Add Component**

3. Physics > Rigidbody

## Components

### Transform

The location, the rotation, and the scale of a game object.

**Position:** Where the object is in the 3D space

**Rotation: **How the object is rotated around its 3 axes

**Scale:** How large it is from it's default size in 3 dimensions

**Every** game object has a transform, even if it doesn't matter or affect anything.

Each of the 3 parts of the transform is represented as a 3 Dimensional Vector. Unity scripting refers to this as a **Vector3**

### Collider

The physical borders of the object which other objects in the scene will collide with. This does not have to be the same size and shape of the **rendered** shape, or what can be seen.

# Coding in C#

### Vocab

**Brackets:**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>< >  </td>
    <td>Angle Brackets</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>( ) </td>
    <td>Parentheses</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>{ }  </td>
    <td>Curly Brackets</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[ ] </td>
    <td>Square Brackets</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>" "</td>
    <td>Double Quotes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>' '</td>
    <td>Single Quotes</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Chunks

* Code in C# is organized into different types of chunks.

* Each Chunk is started (opened) by a **left curly bracket:  ****{**

* Each Chunk is ended (closed) by a **right curly bracket:  ****}**

* **EVERY** Chunk that **opens** must be **closed.**

### Variables

Syntax:

	*type name ***_=_*** value*;

**Types**:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>float</td>
    <td>A Decimal value like 4.67</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>int</td>
    <td>A whole number like 6, -13, or 1024</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>A group of text characters, like "Hello, World". Use Double Quotes to mark the start and the end. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>bool</td>
    <td>A Boolean value, which can be true or false.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>char</td>
    <td>A single character like 'K'. Use Single Quotes to before and after to indicate a character.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**public** 

Adding the word **public** in front of a variable will make it accessible and editable in the editor of Unity.

Example: 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>	public float speed = 10;</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Will allow:

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/LB7Gbq7k9VRpXh7vEUPYVg_img_0.png)
